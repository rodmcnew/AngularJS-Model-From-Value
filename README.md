AngularJS-Model-From-Value
==========================

Rendering forms fields with their values server side is not the angular way, ideally you should be rendering client side if you are using angular. But if you must use angular with a server-side rendered form, this directive will help you do that.

This directive populates angular $scope vars from the values the form fields had when the page loaded.
